A simple Vue application inspired by a very famous social network.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to discover and learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) by trying to recreate the original look of that famous social network without looking at the code. It uses fake data to simulate posts, users and more.

> While the main goal was to discover Tailwind CSS, I ended up enjoying it and I actually made the website entirely responsive!

This project is a single-page application (SPA) made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and uses [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) to offer a variety of views within that single page.

Thanks to [Vue I18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/), it is available in both English and French, and can easily be translated. Translation files can be found in the `/src/locales/` directory.
